# hello-world
Introduction to Github

I am in school to become a Web Developer and finish this May 2016.  I have gained a breadth of knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but of course I want to keep improving and excel at other essential languages for the field, such as jQuery or PHP.

I hope to learn through Git how to improve and solidify my authoring skills as well as contribute towards others' progress in the field.
